I know it is really hard for you at the moment. Have you ever thought to confront it instead of avoiding it? According to the scientific explanation, people with claustrophobia may experience both psychological and physical symptoms such as feeling of anxiety; panic; a feeling that the situation is dangerous; an urge to look for ways out / exit; a desire to move an stay close to an exit; breathing problems; fainting; racing heart; sweating. A number of treatment and techniques are available for dealing with claustrophobia. I suggest you try CBT. It aims to train your mind toward a more positive and rational way of thinking so that you no longer feel anxious about enclosed spaces.

You have already noticed that you spend a lot of money on your food. Let's see if you could do something to save this food cost. For example, in the morning, you could make yourself a coffee at home and take it to your job. It can not only save your cost, but also reduceing using paper cup. And perhaps you could bring a home-made samdwiches to your work for lunch. That would be cheaper and healthier as well. Also you could cook dinner at home or try the cheaper restaurant from time to time. The most important thing is to follow your budget as I mentioned in first tip.\nHope this could help you in some way.\nSincerely,\nEva\n            ", "changes": [{"start": 100, "correct": "expenses", "symbol": "PL", "selection": "expense"}, {"start": 230, "symbol": "D", "selection": "is "}, {"start": 261, "correct": " are", "symbol": "MW"}, {"start": 380, "symbol": "D", "selection": "your "}, {"start": 435, "correct": "on ", "symbol": "PR"}, {"start": 506, "correct": "cup of ", "symbol": "MW"}, {"start": 541, "correct": "work place", "symbol": "WC", "selection": "job"}, {"start": 572, "correct": "money", "symbol": "WC", "selection": "cost"}, {"start": 587, "correct": "reduce", "symbol": "VT", "selection": "reduceing"}, {"start": 597, "correct": " the ", "symbol": "MW"}, {"start": 597, "correct": "use", "symbol": "VT", "selection": "using"}, {"start": 609, "correct": "cups", "symbol": "PL", "selection": "cup"}, {"start": 614, "symbol": "D", "selection": "And"}, {"start": 618, "correct": "Perhaps", "symbol": "C", "selection": "perhaps"}, {"start": 625, "correct": ",", "symbol": "PU"}, {"start": 642, "symbol": "D", "selection": "a "}, {"start": 738, "correct": ",", "symbol": "PU"}, {"start": 776, "correct": "a", "symbol": "AR", "selection": "the"}, {"start": 780, "correct": "cheap", "symbol": "WC", "selection": "cheaper"}, {"start": 886, "correct": "the ", "symbol": "PR"}], "grade": 80}, "C176719": {"id": "C176719", "topic": "3535", "level": "1", "nationality": "cn", "text": "\n            Hi!\nI am fine, and you?\nMy name is Yang yue.

The size land is 288.45 sq m and cottage is 54.15 sq with  extension  up to 150 sqm permittable with  price  $200,000. If you are interested in another property with history, I can recommend one owned by Lady Elizabeth Hamilton. It is much larger than  first one,  land of 1200 sqm approx and  house of 224.76 sq m upstairs and down stairs, including more rooms. This house cannot be demolished and the price is $1.5M. Another new apartments, 67 sqm / 78 sqm can be introduced to you. The price is $160,000 each, including the fittings you choose. Now there are only 3x2 bedroom ones avilable. The last one is a luxurious property for investing. It located in a quiet and traditional corner of the twon with bay, village and mountain scapes surrounding it. Only a few minutes walk to the centre and close to surrounding beaches. The land size is 453.20 sq m and house size is 111.78 sq m. All related facilities are provided with the price of $450.000.
